ELP2000-82B
===========

Given library provides functionality to compute lunar positions and thus allowing contruction of lunar ephemerides.

It is based on semi-analytical **theory ELP version ELP 2000-82B** developed by **M. Chapront-Touzé** and **J. Chapront**
at Bureau des Longitude, Paris, France.

To find information on the theory itself, refer to the following original papers:

This library is implemented in C and needs be linked only against math library.

Provided files contain the following functionality

* **elp2000-82b** is the main file of interest. It contains routines that compute lunar positions depending on desired
  output coordinates and reference frame. Refer to the header comments for more information.
* **arguments** contains routines that compute arguments of the ELP theory. Among such, this file contains a routine
  to compute mean lunar arguments (Delaunay arguments), that may come in need while performing various lunar
  computations.
* **series** contains auxiliary routines that compute Fourier and Poisson series of the ELP theory.
* All other header files define arrays of coefficients of ELP theory and are of no practical use outside given library.
