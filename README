This is an implementation of semi-analytical theory ELP version ELP 2000-82B
developed by M. Chapront-Touzé and J. Chapront at Bureau des Longitude, Paris,
France.

This theory lets you compute relatively accurate geocentric position of the
Moon.

To find information on the theory itself, refer to the following original

   ephemeris adequate for historical times. Astronomy and Astrophysics,

To find information on the usage of the software refer to the comments in the
code (mainly header comment of elp2000-82b.h) or the applied wiki page.

It is implemented in C and needs be linked only against math library.

ELP 2000 uses Fourier series to compute Moon's position. During the computation
of the series, coefficients are stored directly in memory. This was done to
avoid I/O operations and speed up calculations. However, the downside of this is
that the software may use relatively large amounts of memory, which should be
considered before using it.

You are free to compile and use this software in any way you please unless it
causes any harm to someone or something.

You are also free to modify, copy or fork existing source on one condition -
your code that is in any way connected to these sources must
    reference this library by name and include a link where you obtained
    these sources from
or
    include a reference to the original paper by M. Chapront-Touzé and
    J. Chapront
    
This is needed for the option of tracing original source materials and giving
the credit to people who put their time and effort in these studies.
