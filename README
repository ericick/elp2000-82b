This library contains an implementation of the ELP theory version ELP 2000-82B
developed by M. Chapront-Touzé and J. Chapront at Bureau des Longitude, Paris,
France.

This library lets you compute relatively accurate ephemeris of the Moon. For
more information, see header comment of elp2000-82b.h.

It is implemented in C and needs be linked only against math library.

Implementation is based on the following papers:

1) M. Chapront-Touzé and J. Chapront. The lunar ephemeris ELP 2000.
   Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 124, 1983, pp. 50-62.
2) M. Chapront-Touzé and J. Chapront. ELP 2000-85: a semi-analytical lunar
   ephemeris adequate for historical times. Astronomy and Astrophysics,
   vol. 190, 1988, pp. 342-352.
3) M. Chapront-Touzé, J. Chapront, G. Francou. Lunar solution ELP version
   ELP 2000-82B. Observatoire de Paris, 2001 (1985).
4) J. Chapront and G. Francou. The lunar theory ELP revisited. Introduction
   of new planetary perturbations. Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 404,
   2003, pp. 735-742.

You are free to compile and use this library in any way that does not couse
any harm or troubles.

You are also free to copy, use or modify the source code or its parts on one
condition: your source code should reference this library or original papers
it was based on.

Namely, if you include these sources or their parts into some of your projects,
add one of the following comments to your source code:

// Based on elp2000-82b implementation by S. Tsyba
also provide a link where you downloaded sources from

or

// Based on paper by M. Chapront-Touzé and J. Chapront, The lunar ephemeris
// ELP 2000 published at Astronomy and Astrophysics, vol. 124, 1983, pp. 50-62.

This is needed to give credit to scientists and their studies without which 
these implementations would not be possible. This library references original
papers in every source file, so if you reference this library from your sources,
then the credit may be traced to the original papers.
